# Interactable Objects Example
![Interactable Objects](/External/ReadMeImages/MRTK_InteractableObject.jpg)
Example of modular and extensible interactable objects with visual states, including Holographic button

## Mesh button ##
These are the examples using primitives and imported 3D meshes as Interactable Objects. You can easily assign different scale, offset and colors to respond to different input interaction states.

## Holographic button ##
This is an example of Holographic button used in the Start menu and App Bar. This example uses Unity's Animation Controller and Animation Clips.

## Traditional button ##
This example shows a traditional 2D style button with some dimension. Each input state has a slightly different depth and animation properties.  

## Custom 3D objects ##
With HoloLens, you can leverage physical space. Imagine a holographic push button on the physical wall. Or how about a coffee cup on the real table? Using 3D models imported from modeling software, we can create Interactable Object that resembles real life object. Since it is digital object, we can add magical interactions to it.
